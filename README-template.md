## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

.icon{
    width: 45px;
    height: 45px;
    object-fit: contain;
}

This piece of code took me a long time to figure out. I wanted the icons to be equal in height and width with the padding on.
